## Docs

1. Worked on a time with **[[Joy Hangartner]]** to get her reconnected to the NAS. She was previously disconnected due to her ethernet port being accidently placed in a VLAN which gave her an IP address that couldn't access the NAS.
   1. I was able to remote into Joy's PC and get her reconnected to the NAS.
2. Pushed an update for SentinelOne out to all Windows clients which will update according to maintenance windows. I also allowed for downgrading.
3. Updated port numbering documentation in Google Drive. Also added documentation to Monday for ease of access.
4. Labeled as many wall ports as I could until I ran out of film. Got 3/4 of the conference/sim room above Product Support.
5. Terminated a new line for Kelsie's workstation
6. Started hunting down which ports are which from Marketing to data closet to reconfigure the patch panels so that the new numbers match.
   1. Including fiber
   2. I think I made an oopsie... Evan came by the data closet right as I was switching his cable over saying that he had been out of internet for a few minutes. I was super confused until I noticed that the entire switch was out of power. The cable had managed to come unplugged, but for the life of me I can't figure out how that happened. All I did was move his cable over 1 port in the patch panel.
7. After realizing that **[[Nate Sorrill]]**'s PC was not connecting to 10GbE via fiber I was able to get it reconnected using the CLI command.
